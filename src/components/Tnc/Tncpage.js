              The Company may make use of third party servers to process these
              recordings for a short duration, and thereafter only store them on
              our own service infrastructure. However, the recordings of
              Sessions may be made available to Instructors or any Company’s
              representatives. The Company shall have the right to use such

              disclosure is reasonably necessary to: (a) comply with legal
              process, applicable laws or government requests; (b) enforce these
