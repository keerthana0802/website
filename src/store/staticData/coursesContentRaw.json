        "Public Speaking": "Children often shy away from speaking in public or even infront of their peers in class, while being talkative otherwise. In our course, we guide the children to overcome the hesitation of delivering speech infront of an audience. \n\nIn this course, the students will practice different styles of public speaking such as improvisation, informative, and persuasive style of delivery, which they can apply in their everyday life � such as speaking in class, in a school assembly or a poetry recital, participating in elocution or debate competitions. The course will enable them to deliver speech in a crisp, engaging, and a memorable way.

        "Debate": "Debating is a powerful activity that develops cognitive and communication skills in children. Some of the most impressive public leaders are ex-debators � from Barack Obama, Nelson Mandela, Jeff Bezos to Oprah Winfrey. Being a great orator is a key part of leadership. \n\nThis course is designed to engage children through speaking activities which impart skills and techniques while making it super easy and fun to participate. Through structured debate sessions, children will also prepare with research, collaborate, practice their arguments and rebuttals.

        "Western Vocals": "Neuroscientists have shown how music engages and strengthens practically every area of the brain. Learning music helps children build their linguistic and memory skills. That said, the joy of music is a gift that keeps on giving!\n\nThe voice happens to be the one instrument we all grow up playing and using. We all sing from a young age and learn to appreciate the talent of those who have learnt to use it well. This will serve as the starting point for that journey, there are no pre-requisites and you don�t need to have any background in singing or any training in music theory.\n\nIn this course, we will cover 3 pillars crucial to the development and interest in music and singing: Performing, appreciating and composing. The performing element is important for children to have fun singing their favourite songs. The appreciating element is important for children to listen to and understand different kinds of music, singers and genres. The composing element will allow children to use what they have learnt to make something unique to their voice.\n\nThis course has two levels and as students progress from one level to the other, they build deeper understanding of music. \nThe learning outcomes for the two levels are given below:\n\nWestern Vocals Beginner:\n� Understand pitch and rhythm with appropriate singing technique\n� Learn about dynamics, phrasing and interpretation\n� Be able to sing songs of different genres and cultures\n� Write a short piece and sing a self-composed melody\n\nWestern Vocals Intermediate:\n- Learn how to sing a major and minor arpeggio\n- Recognize melodies and difference in vocal tone, be able to repeat and retain them\n- Recognize visually and aurally the difference between subdivisions\n- Use and recognize kodaly rhythm syllables\n- Understand the vocabulary of rhythm notation\n- Recognize and sing three different notes\n\nNumber of sessions: 12 sessions + 12 at home materials for the student to do post session  ?\nDuration of each session: 1 hour each             \nCourse fee: 4800/-\nSize of session: 5-6 students",
        "Guitar": "Did you know that playing an instrument is a great exercise for your brain! Guitar happens to be one of the most recognizable instruments in the world. There has been enough scientific research to show how learning guitar helps in improving memory and building concentration amongst students. \n\nWith its ability to perform as a great harmonic or melodic instrument, the guitar has found its way in almost all of popular music. If you can get past the first few weeks with patience, the instrument will reward you. The starting point for most beginners is to be able to play short melodic phrases like a scale and basic chord shapes and changes. There are no pre-requisites and you don�t need to have played the guitar before or any training in music theory.\n\nThis course will cover the 3 pillars crucial to the development of skill and interest: Performing, appreciating and composing. The performing element focuses on training students to be able to play short and simple pieces that they love. The appreciating element is important for students to listen to and understand different kinds of music, guitars and genres. The composing element will allow students to use what they have learnt to make a short musical piece.\n\nThis course has two levels and as students progress from one level to the other, they build deeper understanding of playing guitar. \nThe learning outcomes for the two levels are given below:\n\nNumber of sessions: 14 sessions + 14 at home materials for the student to do post session  ?\nDuration of each session: 1 hour each             \nCourse fee: 5800/-\nSize of session: 2-3 students",
        "Stop Motion Animation": "Stop Motion Animation is a fun and exciting activity that uses photography techniques to make inanimate objects come to life! Think Mickey Mouse to Isle of Dogs, stop motion animation has been widely popular for a long time now. \n\nIt allows children to enjoy unstructured play, sequencing and structuring their thoughts with immediate visual outputs. The students will get a chance to use their imagination and take their story telling skills to a new level in their own unique way.\n\nThe course will cover basics of stop motion animation, storytelling and storyboarding techniques, animation with 2D and with 3D objects / figures, adding sounds, and finally making their own short film. They will also learn one additional format to apply this technique (animated GIFs or a flipbook).",
        "Stop Motion Animation Senior": "Everyone loves a good story! Distracted by gadgets as we are today, why don�t we use those gadgets to our advantage? \n\nStop Motion Animation course is ideal for your child to channel their imagination and creativity into making their own short film! Because of stop motion animation�s simple nature of capturing and showcasing stories, it becomes a super easy concept to grasp for kids of all ages. It allows children to enjoy unstructured play, sequencing and structuring their thoughts with immediate visual outputs.\n\nIn this course, students will learn the basics of animation and then go deeper into the process to create sophisticated animated films. They will make detailed scenes and actions by employing professional methods and techniques used by top animation studios today. Students will engage in character building exercises, set-construction and work with different media like craft paper, clay, cardboard, felt, wires and many more. Light and sound techniques are essential elements to build stories and effects, students will learn to use these.\n\nThrough this course, students will work on one animated story, layering it with more detail and elements over each class, to culminate into a high-quality animated film (As a side benefit, working across weeks on one �masterpiece� also develops focus and patience in children, who are otherwise easily distracted!). They will also learn to use the technique in other fun ways such as flipbook and creating their own animated gifs.\n\nNo prior experience is needed.",
        "Art Explorer": "All children love art, and while it may appear as fun and games, children develop spatial intelligence and innovative, original thinking.  As the name suggests, the Art Explorer course is designed to help students explore various forms and media such as collage, finger painting, paper weaving, and clay. \n\nExploring various art forms broadens the child�s understanding of what art is and how they can �create� in multiple ways. From exploring colours to 3D forms, each class brings a new way to look at art. Through the process, children will learn basic techniques and make connections with life around them.\n\nStudents need no prior training for this course. The materials needed are basic art supplies such as drawing paper, colours (crayons/oil pastels, water colours), coloured paper, modeling clay and so on. The teacher will guide them at every step.",
        "Art Beginner": "Art is a universal language to express ideas and emotions. Children love art, but rarely get a structured education on mastering techniques and unlocking creativity.\n\nIn this course, students will learn powerful, yet simplified, concepts to make their drawing better and learn colour theory and techniques of application. They will also discuss artwork of famous artists such as Vincent Van Gogh, Claude Monet, Henri Matisse, Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, and learn art appreciation. Through learning and exploration, students are also encouraged to look at art in multiple ways, and evolve their own style. \n\nNo prior training is required.",
        "Photography": "Photography is the perfect tool to harness a child�s creativity and curiosity. Developing a keen eye at a young age can help enhance the way you view and interact with the world. Moreover, it is easy and fun.\n\nPhotography course will cover key concepts such as composition, correctly balancing exposure and light, types of photography (portrait, silhouette, panorama) and a brief history of the medium. We will train the eye to really observe details, and equip students with the tools required to effectively capture the world around them, find beauty in the things they see (and see them in different ways), and tell a story through images.\n\nIt is a hands-on course where students will be encouraged to explore their surroundings and apply what they learn in each session in a fun and stimulating way. No prior experience of photography is required. A basic digital camera is preferred, though a cell phone camera will also suffice. DSLRs are welcome too.\n\nCome, let�s learn to see the magic in the ordinary."
