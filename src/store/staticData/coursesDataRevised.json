Stop Motion Animation course is ideal for your child to channel their imagination and creativity into making their own short film! Because of stop motion animation’s simple nature of capturing and showcasing stories, it becomes a super easy concept to grasp for kids of all ages. It allows children to enjoy unstructured play, sequencing and structuring their thoughts with immediate visual outputs. In this course, students will learn the basics of animation and then go deeper into the process to create sophisticated animated films. They will make detailed scenes and actions by employing professional methods and techniques used by top animation studios today. Students will engage in character building exercises, set-construction and work with different media like craft paper, clay, cardboard, felt, wires and many more. Light and sound techniques are essential elements to build stories and effects, students will learn to use these. Through this course, students will work on one animated story, layering it with more detail and elements over each class, to culminate into a high-quality animated film (As a side benefit, working across weeks on one ‘masterpiece’ also develops focus and patience in children, who are otherwise easily distracted!). They will also learn to use the technique in other fun ways such as flipbook and creating their own animated gifs. No prior experience is needed.",

Stop Motion Animation course is ideal for your child to channel their imagination and creativity into making their own short film! Because of stop motion animation’s simple nature of capturing and showcasing stories, it becomes a super easy concept to grasp for kids of all ages. It allows children to enjoy unstructured play, sequencing and structuring their thoughts with immediate visual outputs. In this course, students will learn the basics of animation and then go deeper into the process to create sophisticated animated films. They will make detailed scenes and actions by employing professional methods and techniques used by top animation studios today. Students will engage in character building exercises, set-construction and work with different media like craft paper, clay, cardboard, felt, wires and many more. Light and sound techniques are essential elements to build stories and effects, students will learn to use these. Through this course, students will work on one animated story, layering it with more detail and elements over each class, to culminate into a high-quality animated film (As a side benefit, working across weeks on one ‘masterpiece’ also develops focus and patience in children, who are otherwise easily distracted!). They will also learn to use the technique in other fun ways such as flipbook and creating their own animated gifs. No prior experience is needed.",

We will train the eye to really observe details, and equip students with the tools required to effectively capture the world around them, find beauty in the things they see (and see them in different ways), and tell a story through images. It is a hands-on course where students will be encouraged to explore their surroundings and apply what they learn in each session in a fun and stimulating way.

As the name suggests, the Art Explorer course is designed to help students explore various forms and media such as collage, finger painting, paper weaving, and clay. Exploring various art forms broadens the childâ€™s understanding of what art is and how they can â€˜createâ€™ in multiple ways. From exploring colours to 3D forms, each class brings a new way to look at art. Through the process, children will learn basic techniques and make connections with life around them. Students need no prior training for this course. The materials needed are basic art supplies such as drawing paper, colours (crayons/oil pastels, water colours), coloured paper, modeling clay and so on. The teacher will guide them at every step.",
